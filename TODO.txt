Need to move all the ui stuff into ui folder.
need to convert it to using a single entry point, and react router, instead of weird, bespoke html pages.
Need to make sure that that singe entry point still gets templated, to load the csp nonce

remove using redux oidc stuff for login to profile pages.
	instead, just do something closer to the background auth checking.  We're the idp, we can just look at the cookie.

See if different entry points work as desired, with only including what's needed for each page, or if big spa with delayed loading works just as well.

Need to make sure that we can still provide data from the backend to the page as it renders.
	this is for stuff like "app name".  Ideally, we still pass it by templating in tags that get rendered to json


Start moving to typescript
Add linting preventing unused imports
add lining preventing unused variables
